# Midterm for Interactive Digital Multimedia - ARS361
***

a project with *p5js*

Concept:
Create a piece that transports the user from one world to another, based on some change of input. Formally, your world should feature at least one set of repeating elements. Conceptually, make your worlds reflect two different emotional states, or states of being.

Use the techniques that we have gone over in class, but keep in mind that this is CREATIVE assignment: we will be talking about your work on the basis of what it communicates, how it makes us feel, and what it makes us think. The tools should be in the service of your concepts.

Be prepared to talk a little about your work. You should be able to articulate what you were thinking about when you made it.


How to run project:
1. You need to store the _html_, _css_, _js_, _images_, and _audio_ files in the same directory.
2. Proceed to run, or use the GitHub pages link I have set up.
